# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Definitely the last hash challenge where you pull out only if the value is true
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note-taking is going really well actually. The color coding and having a table of content is very helpful. I take the best notes when I'm energized or excited
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Lots of googling and then trying it out in replit
